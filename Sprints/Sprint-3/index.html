    3. continue work on brick hit detection<br>
    <br>
    <b>Things completed in class last week:</b> <br>
    Worked on brick hit detection, works except for corners.

    <b>Completed in sprint 3:</b>
    <br>I was able to move everything into classes with Scene Manager.<br>
    Right now, I'm not entirely sure how to handle keeping track of highscores. Right now I'm just keeping it in the global namespace.<br>
    I also added a keyUp() function into my Scene classes because of what I discussed with you after class last wednesday. However, this is causing a blocker.<br>
    My events aren't doing anything anymore. Additionally, my styling has been lost?<br>
