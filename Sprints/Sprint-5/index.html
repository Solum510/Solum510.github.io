    <b>Completed in sprint 5:</b>
        So brick breaker has been put into game objects and components, after much trial and tribulation.<br>
        However, my game over isn't being handled correctly right now, instead throws a reference error.<br>
        Also, when the ball hits a brick, it currently does not bounce again. Will investigate further.<br>
