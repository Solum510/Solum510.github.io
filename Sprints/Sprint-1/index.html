    <p><b>Objectives for sprint 1:</b> <br>
    1. google stag programming and see what it's like<br>
    2. refactor what we worked in class to be less garbage<br>
    3. add a highscores screen maybe<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    1. I found this article and read it: https://www.studytonight.com/3d-game-engineering-with-unity/game-development-architecture<br>
    however, it seemed like most of the things that came up when I googled "standard architecture game programming" was out of scope for this class right now.<br>
    <br>
    2. For objective 2, I want to shove basically all of the meaty code into methods, so that my code is easier to manage and understand. <br>
    That way, when the game state changes, I'm not struggling trying to figure out where stuff starts/ends. <br>
    This is probably not the proper way to make the code easier to understand and more flexible, but this is the first way that popped into my mind. <br>
    <br>
    side comment: having this stuff in multiple files would be nice. <br>

    <b>Objectives for sprint 1 in class:</b> <br>
    I think I want to work on creating the repository for the final project that will be going onto github pages, and then plug this repo onto it. <br>
    I'll be shoving the pong game into a pong directory so users should be able to navigate using the url for now. I believe. <br>
    Next, turning the pong game into brick breaker is something I think I would like to do.</p><br>
