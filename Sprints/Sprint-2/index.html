    <p><b>Objectives for sprint 2:</b> <br>
    1. refactor pong game such that it uses standard architecture,<br>
    start turning the game into brick breaker<br>
    2. figure out how to get some bricks on the screen<br>
    3. start the collision detection for bricks?<br>
    <br>
    <b>Things completed in class last week:</b> <br>
    Deployed repository onto github pages. Added some neat little navigation and this sprints section, just for fun. 
    <br>Started thinking about turning the game into brick breaker<br>
    <br>
    <b>Completed in sprint 2:</b>
    <br>Refactoring pong by splitting it into two files was not too difficult. Next I need to figure out how to initialize bricks.<br>
    I was able to initialize and draw the bricks. Getting some of the math was a little tricky, and I had some issues wrapping my head around it.<br>
    I also ended up having some trouble trying to figure out how to get my bricks array to initialize at the start of the game. Right now, I just opted<br>
    for a boolean flag. It's only true on init and swaps to false once initBricks is called. It works for now.<br>
